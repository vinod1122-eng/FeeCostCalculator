Business Cost Calculator - Project Documentation

Introduction
The Business Cost Calculator is a web application designed to help users estimate the costs associated with starting a new business or project. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting various services and calculating the total price, with the added benefit of converting costs 
to different currencies using an external API.

Technology Stack
Backend: ASP.NET Core MVC
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Session Management: In-memory session storage
External Service: Currency conversion API (exchange-rate-api.com)
JSON Parsing: Newtonsoft.Json (for handling API responses)

Project Structure
Models:
SubService: Represents a specific service offered within a broader category (e.g., "Logo Design" under "Brand Strategy & Design").
Service: Represents a main service category with a collection of associated sub-services.

Controllers:
CalculatorController: Handles user interactions, service selections, cost calculations, and currency conversion.

Services:
CurrencyConverterService: Fetches exchange rates from an external API and performs currency conversions.

Views:
_Layout.cshtml: Defines the main layout and structure for all pages.
Index.cshtml: The initial landing page.
Views for each service category (e.g., BrandStrategy.cshtml).
Result.cshtml: Displays the calculated cost and selected services.

Static Files:
wwwroot/css: Contains CSS stylesheets for styling the application.
wwwroot/images: Stores images used in the application.
wwwroot/js: Contains JavaScript files for handling interactivity.




Workflow
Landing Page: The user is presented with an introductory page with a call to action to start the cost calculation process.
Service Selection: The user navigates through different service categories and selects the sub-services they require.
Cost Calculation: The selected services and their prices are used to calculate the total cost in USD.
Currency Conversion (Optional): The user can choose a target currency, and the CurrencyConverterService fetches the exchange rate from the API 
to convert the total cost.

Result Display: The final cost, converted cost (if applicable), and selected services are displayed to the user.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for service selection and cost estimation.
Dynamic Service Selection: The service structure allows for flexible addition and modification of services and their prices.
Real-Time Currency Conversion: Integrates with an external API for accurate and up-to-date currency conversions.

Session Management: User selections are maintained across multiple requests using session storage.
Error Handling: Implements basic error handling to gracefully handle API request failures or conversion errors.
Assumptions and Considerations
The application relies on the availability and reliability of the external currency conversion API.
Error handling and validation could be further improved to provide more specific and user-friendly messages.
Consider implementing caching mechanisms for exchange rates to reduce API calls and improve performance.
The application could benefit from user authentication, data persistence (e.g., saving cost estimates), and more advanced reporting capabilities.








Future Enhancements
User Accounts: Allow users to create accounts to save their cost estimates, track project progress, and access historical data.
Detailed Reports: Generate customisable reports with breakdowns of costs for each selected service, comparisons between currencies, and other relevant financial insights.
Enhanced Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling with detailed error messages and potential fallback mechanisms in case of API unavailability.
Admin Panel: Provide an administrative interface to manage services, prices, currency options, and other application settings.
Integration with other services Integrate with project management or invoicing tools to streamline workflows.
Conclusion
The Business Cost Calculator is a practical and valuable tool for individuals and businesses looking to estimate project costs and make informed financial decisions. Its user-friendly interface, dynamic service selection, and real-time currency conversion capabilities make it a versatile solution for various use cases. The application can evolve into a more comprehensive and powerful financial planning tool by incorporating the suggested enhancements.

Business Cost Calculator - Key Points
Purpose: Helps users estimate the costs of starting a new business or project.
Tech Stack: ASP.NET Core MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a currency conversion API.
How it Works: Users select services, the app calculates the total cost and then converts it to different currencies (optional).
Features: Easy to use, flexible service options, real-time currency conversion, and basic error handling.
Future Ideas: User accounts, detailed reports, better error handling, admin panel, and integration with other services.


Some key assumptions and considerations for users of the Business Cost Calculator:
API Reliability: The tool relies on an external currency conversion API. Any downtime or inaccuracies in the API could affect the results.
Error Handling: While the calculator has basic error handling, it might not cover all scenarios. Users should double-check their inputs and be prepared for potential issues.
Caching: The app could benefit from caching exchange rates to reduce API calls and improve performance. This is something to consider for future updates.
Future Features: The calculator currently lacks user accounts, detailed reports, and advanced admin features. These are planned enhancements that could greatly improve its functionality.
